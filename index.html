<h1>{{ "About me" }}</h1>
Nice to see you, stranger. I'm a C++ programmer, and use this language as a main one. I also have experience in other languages, such as Lua, Pawn, Python, JS. 
I've got some gamedev skills, specifically in such areas as computer graphics (OpenGL), system programming (WinAPI), and reverse-engineering at a basic level (x86 assembly only). 
I'm also experienced with ImGui, SFML, SDL2, PolyHook2 libraries. I know how to use Git and CMake. I did a huge contribution to Half-Life 1 modding and took part in the development of 
the Xash3D FWGS game engine, furthermore leaded several of my own open source projects. You can find the projects list on this site.
