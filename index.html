<h1>{{ "About me" }}</h1>
Nice to see you, stranger. I'm a C++ programmer, and use this language as main. But also I have experience in other languages, such as Lua, Pawn, Python, JS.
I have programming experience in gamedev, specifically in such areas as computer graphics (OpenGL), system programming (WinAPI), and reverse-engineering on base level (x86 assembly only).
Also I have experience with ImGui, SFML, SDL2, PolyHook2 libraries. I know how to use Git and CMake. I did a huge contribution to Half-Life 1 modding and take part in 
the development of the Xash3D FWGS game engine, but also lead several of my own open source projects. You can find projets list on this site.
