# About me
I'm self-taught software engineer and I use C++ language as a main one. But also have some experience with other programming languages, such as Lua, Pawn, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript. 
Most of my skills are directly related to game development, but also I have experience in such areas as computer graphics, system programming, network programming, and reverse-engineering at a basic level (x86/amd64 only, not familiar with other architectures).  
  
I did a significant contribution to Half-Life 1 modding and now taking part in the development of the Xash3D FWGS game engine, furthermore leading several of my own open-source projects. Also, I did contributions for many other open-source projects. You can find more detailed information in sections on this site.
