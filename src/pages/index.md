# About me
I'm a software developer, and use C++ language as a main one. But also have experience in other languages, such as Lua, Pawn, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript. 
I've got some gamedev skills, specifically in such areas as computer graphics (OpenGL), system programming (WinAPI), and reverse-engineering at a basic level (x86 assembly).  
  
I'm also have experience of using ImGui, SFML, SDL2, PolyHook2 libraries and know how to use Git and CMake. I did a huge contribution to Half-Life 1 modding and took part in the development of 
the Xash3D FWGS game engine, furthermore leaded several of my own open-source projects. You can find more information in sections on this site.
