# About me

I'm self-taught software engineer and C++ is my main language. But also I have some experience with other programming languages, such as Lua, Pawn, Python, JavaScript and TypeScript. 
Most of my skills are directly related to game development, but not limited to it. I have experience in such areas as computer graphics, system programming, network programming and reverse-engineering at a basic level for x86/AMD64 architectures.  
  
I did a significant contribution to Half-Life 1 modding scene and now taking part in the development of the Xash3D FWGS game engine, furthermore leading my own open-source projects. Also, I did contributions for many other open-source projects. You can find more detailed information in sections on this site.
