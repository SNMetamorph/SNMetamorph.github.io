# PrimeXT
Modern SDK for the Xash3D FWGS engine, to work on modern platforms with cross-platform support and improved graphics/physics, while retaining all the features and approaches to work inherent in GoldSrc and Xash3D. Based on XashXT, and therefore has all the functionality inherent in XashXT and Spirit Of Half-Life. Suitable for creating both singleplayer and multiplayer mods. Development started in August 2021.
