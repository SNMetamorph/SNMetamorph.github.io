# PrimeXT
Modern toolkit for Xash3D FWGS engine, with cross-platform support, improved graphics/physics, and a lot of new features for mod-makers, while retaining all the approaches to work inherent from GoldSrc and vanilla Xash3D. Also all the functionality from XashXT and Spirit Of Half-Life was inherited too. Suitable for creating both singleplayer and multiplayer mods. Development was started in August 2021.
