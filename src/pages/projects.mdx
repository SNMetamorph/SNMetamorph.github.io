# PrimeXT
Modern toolkit for Xash3D FWGS engine, with cross-platform support, improved graphics/physics, and a lot of new features for mod-makers, while retaining all the approaches to work inherent from GoldSrc and vanilla Xash3D. Also all the functionality from XashXT and Spirit Of Half-Life was inherited too. Suitable for creating both singleplayer and multiplayer mods. Development was started in August 2021.

# GoldSrc Monitor
Simple and standalone utility with bunch of functions for mapping, scripting, speedrunning, debugging or researching 
games based on GoldSrc/Xash3D FWGS engines (such as Half-Life 1, CS 1.6, and other HL-mods). Development was started in 2019, but is currently inactive.

# Reverse-engineered procedural VFX from Silent Hill 3
Reverse-engineered implementation of procedural texturing visual effect "Another World Evil" from Silent Hill 3. Demonstration program with reimplementation of original algorithm was made back in 2019, you could check how it looks in video demonstration below. Someday I will write post with explanations about this VFX algorithm and how I reverse-engineered it.

# ESPHome component for JHS manufactured AC units
Component for air conditioning units manufactured by JHS (Timberk, Hyundai, Scoole, and other brands), makes possible to control AC from Home Assistant through Wi-Fi connection using ESP8266/ESP32.  It works by using UART interface between Wi-Fi module and AC main board, and in this scheme ESP8266 or ESP32 are used as replacement for Wi-Fi module (even if AC unit does not have module out of the box).

# Library for VFDs based on Futaba M202MD10C board
Library for Arduino framework for convenient working with vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD) based on Futaba M202MD10C board.
Implements as much as possible functions that display supports, such as dimming, user-defined symbols, code pages, cursor visibility toggle, self-testing mode.
